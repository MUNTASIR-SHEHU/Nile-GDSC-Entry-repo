# Data Science Tasks

## Task 1: Multi-Source Data Integration and Advanced Analytics
Combine multiple data sources and extract complex insights.

**Requirements:**
- Integrate at least 3 different data sources (APIs, databases, files)
- Handle data quality issues (duplicates, conflicts, missing values)
- Perform advanced feature engineering with domain knowledge
- Build ensemble model with stacking/boosting
- Achieve >85% accuracy or appropriate metric
- Create automated data pipeline
- Document data lineage and transformations

## Task 2: Time Series Forecasting with Multiple Variables
Build a multivariate time series forecasting system.

**Requirements:**
- Load time series data with multiple features
- Handle seasonality, trends, and anomalies
- Implement ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet model
- Add external regressors
- Perform walk-forward validation
- Calculate forecast intervals
- Compare with baseline and neural network approach

## Task 3: Causal Inference Analysis
Determine causal relationships, not just correlations.

**Requirements:**
- Load observational data
- Identify potential confounders
- Implement propensity score matching or similar
- Perform difference-in-differences analysis
- Calculate treatment effects with confidence intervals
- Validate assumptions (parallel trends, etc.)
- Provide policy recommendations based on causal findings
