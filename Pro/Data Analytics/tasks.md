# Data Analytics Tasks

## Task 1: Dynamic Pricing Optimization Engine
Build a sophisticated pricing optimization system using advanced analytics.

**Requirements:**
- Analyze historical pricing, demand, and competitor data
- Implement price elasticity modeling with segmentation
- Build demand forecasting with multiple external factors
- Create constraint-based optimization (inventory, margins, competition)
- Implement dynamic pricing algorithm with reinforcement learning
- Perform cannibalization analysis across products
- Simulate pricing scenarios with Monte Carlo methods
- Provide profit maximization strategies with risk assessment

## Task 2: Fraud Detection System with Explainability
Design a comprehensive fraud detection and prevention system.

**Requirements:**
- Build real-time anomaly detection on transaction streams
- Implement graph-based fraud detection (network analysis)
- Use ensemble methods for fraud classification (>95% precision)
- Create explainable AI outputs for each fraud decision
- Implement adaptive learning to evolve with fraud patterns
- Calculate false positive/negative costs
- Build feedback loop for model improvement
- Design investigation workflow with priority scoring

## Task 3: Supply Chain Optimization with Uncertainty
Optimize complex supply chain using advanced analytics.

**Requirements:**
- Model multi-tier supply chain network
- Implement demand forecasting with uncertainty quantification
- Build inventory optimization with stochastic modeling
- Perform scenario analysis (disruptions, demand shocks)
- Create multi-objective optimization (cost, service level, risk)
- Implement what-if analysis tool
- Calculate value at risk and conditional value at risk
- Design resilience strategies with quantified trade-offs
