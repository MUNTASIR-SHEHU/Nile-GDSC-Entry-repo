# Data Visualization Tasks

## Task 1: Multi-Dimensional Data Explorer
Create an advanced visualization system for high-dimensional data.

**Requirements:**
- Load dataset with 10+ features
- Implement parallel coordinates plot
- Create correlation matrix with clustering
- Build interactive dimension reduction visualization (t-SNE or UMAP)
- Add brushing and linking between views
- Implement feature importance overlay
- Handle at least 10,000 data points smoothly

## Task 2: Real-time Streaming Visualization Dashboard
Build a live dashboard that updates with streaming data.

**Requirements:**
- Simulate or connect to real data stream
- Create at least 5 real-time updating charts
- Implement sliding time window
- Add anomaly detection with visual alerts
- Optimize for performance (60fps updates)
- Include cumulative statistics panels
- Add export functionality for current view

## Task 3: Advanced Network Graph Visualization
Visualize complex network relationships with interactive exploration.

**Requirements:**
- Load network data (nodes and edges with attributes)
- Implement force-directed layout
- Add community detection and coloring
- Create node filtering by centrality metrics
- Implement path highlighting between nodes
- Show network statistics (degree distribution, clustering coefficient)
- Handle networks with 1000+ nodes efficiently
